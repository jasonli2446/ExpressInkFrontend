# ExpressInk


ExpressInc is a web application designed to help parents understand their children's emotional states through image analysis. By uploading images that do not contain faces, ExpressInc utilizes OmniStack's pre-trained models to detect moods and infer mental states based on contextual cues within the images. This tool is particularly beneficial for parents of children who have difficulty expressing their feelings verbally, such as those on the autism spectrum. The application provides insights into the child's potential mood and suggests activities or interventions to support their well-being.
